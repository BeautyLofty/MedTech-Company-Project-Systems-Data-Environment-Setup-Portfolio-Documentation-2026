# MedTech-Company-Project-Systems-Data-Environment-Setup-Portfolio-Documentation-2026

This project involved the design and implementation of a simulated IT and workforce systems environment for a
fictional MedTech company. The environment was built to replicate real-world healthcare and NHS-style
operations with strong focus on security, governance, compliance, and operational reliability.
The project aimed to demonstrate practical competence in systems administration, user lifecycle management,
data reporting, and audit processes.
